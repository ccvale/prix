# Prix - the dashboard for my journey across the US

I am graduating college, and going on a month long road trip across the country. Along the way, I want to manage all of the things I see and encounter along the way...

## The route? (not final)

Essentially, this trip is a big circle encompassing the majority of the United States; to fit everything into a one month timeslot, some sacrifices had to be made (sorry Vegas, and many others), but we will be seeing a large percentage of the the things we want to see. Because of this, while preparing for the trip, I decided that something unique that I can bring to the table is a simple dynamic way for us to automate some of the 'keeping track' of things we see along the way.

## Desired Features

This will be my first attempt developing an app with Swift; the purpose of the app is to be sideloaded on my phone during the trip, so events can be recorded and handled with the trip dashboard.

Some things I plan on observing throughout the trip:

- A tab for each destination of the trip
  - Weather on hand for all of the destinations, built in (as opposed to looking it up, or storing 20 different favorites in the default weather app)
  - Checklist; allow for many different themed lists, and allow things to be checked off, and added (ex. sights to see, food to try, etc.)
- Licence plate tracker (as a fan and collector of licence plates, I think it'd be interesting to see how many plates/50 that can be found along the way)
- State ranker; using our home state of New Jersey (underrated, for the record) as a baseline, using certain metrics to track and compile a leaderboard of the top ranking states on the trip
